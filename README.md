Sock Goodies is a site that I launched in February of 2013. I hand coded everything in Notepad. I have since switched to Sublime text 2. 
The site is HTML, CSS and j Query. The only part of the site that I did not code is the payment page. The payment gateway company hosts this page on their secure server so that the payments can be processed securely. They used the code I did from another page and combined it with a template that they already had on their server. They also did the CGI scripting on this page. 

Sock Goodies is a monthly sock and candy subscription service. Each month, the subscriber is surprised with a new pair of socks and candy. They don't know in advance what style of socks or type of candy that they will receive.
